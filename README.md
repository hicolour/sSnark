# sSnark

 This is a Scala library for building circuits for preprocessing zk-SNARK
 
 Higly inspired by [jsnark](https://github.com/hicolour/jsnark)& [xjsnark](https://github.com/hicolour/xjsnark), written in functional manner.
 
 Main purpose of thelibrary is to faciliate [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark) - library implementing zkSNARK schemes, which are a cryptographic method for proving/verifying, in zero knowledge, the integrity of computations (devleoped by [Succinct Computational Integrity and Privacy Research](http://www.scipr-lab.org) group). 
 
 zk-Snarks and its [libsnark] implementation becomes first choice for zero knowledge proofs systems, implemneted maily for cryptocurrency transactions eg. [zerocash], [zcash] and rencentyly [ethereum]
